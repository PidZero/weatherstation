This project is intended, to simplify the access to weather and time data from your C++ project. 

With curlwrap.h you have a simple libcurl wrapper, which stores the reply to a stringstream.

With weatherstation.h you can use your OpenWeatherMap ID to get weatherdata and time from openweathermap.org and your time from worldtimeapi.org.
